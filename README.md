Iris 

An iris – species unspecified – is one of the state flowers of Tennessee. Tradition holds that the particular iris symbolizing Tennessee is a purple cultivar, to go alongside the wild-growing Purple Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata), which is the state's other floral emblem. Greeneville, Tennessee is home to the annual Iris Festival celebrating the iris, local customs, and culture.
The artist George Gessert has specialised in breeding irises.
The artist Vincent van Gogh painted several famous pictures of irises.
